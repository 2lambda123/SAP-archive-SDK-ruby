[![Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/RecastAI.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/RecastAI)

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RecastAI/SDK-ruby/master/misc/logo-inline.png "Recast.AI")

Recast.AI official SDK in Ruby.


## Synospis

This gem is a pure Ruby interface to the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API. It allows you to make requests to your bots.


## Requirements

* Ruby 2.2+


## Installation

```bash
gem install 'RecastAI'
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'recastai'

client = RecastAI::Client.new(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_LANGUAGE)

# text request
responseFromText = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT)

# file request
responseFromFile = client.file_request(File.new(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), YOUR_FILE)))

if responseFromText.intent == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT
  # Do your code...
end
```

## Specs

### Classes

This gem contains 5 main classes, as follows:

* RecastAI::Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
* RecastAI::Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* RecastAI::Sentence represents a sentence of the response.
* RecastAI::Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
* RecastAI::RecastError is the error thrown by the gem.

Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented ;)

## RecastAI::Client

The Client can be instanciated with a token and a language (both optional)

```ruby
client = RecastAI::Client.new(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_LANGUAGE)
```

#### Your tokens


*Copy paste your request access token in your bot's settings*

#### Your language

```ruby
client = RecastAI::Client.new(YOUR_TOKEN, 'en')
```

*The language is a lowercase isocode.*

### Text Request

text_request(text, options = {})

If you pass a token or a language in the options parameter, it will override your default client language or token

```ruby
response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT)

if response.intent == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT
  # Do your code...
end
```

```ruby
# With optional parameters
response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT, { token: YOUR_TOKEN, language: YOUR_LANGUAGE })
```

__If a language is provided:__ the language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used.

__If no language is provided:__ the language of the text is detected and is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used for processing.

### File request

file_request(file, options = {})

If you pass a token or a language in the option parameter, it will override your default client language or token.

__file format: .wav__
```ruby
response = client.file_request(File.new(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__),YOUR_FILE)))

if response.intent == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT
  # Do your code...
end
```

```ruby
# with optional parameters
response = client.file_request(File.new(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__),YOUR_FILE)), { token: YOUR_TOKEN, language: YOUR_LANGUAGE })
```

__If a language is provided:__ the language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used

__If no language is provided:__ your bot's primary language is used for processing as we do not provide language detection for speech.


## RecastAI::Response

The Response is generated after a call to either file_request or text_request.
