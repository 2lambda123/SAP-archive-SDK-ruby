## Specs

### Classes

This gem contains 5 main classes, as follows:

* RecastAI::Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
* RecastAI::Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* RecastAI::Sentence represents a sentence of the response.
* RecastAI::Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
* RecastAI::RecastError is the error thrown by the gem.

Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented ;)

### RecastAI::Client

The Recast.AI Client can be instanciated with a token and provides the two following methods:

* text_request(text, options = {}) *Performs a text request*
* file_request(file, options = {}) *Performs a voice file request*

*Accepted options are :token, to override the default token provided at initialization*

### RecastAI::Response

The Recast.AI Response is generated after a call with the two previous methods and contains the following methods:

* raw(\*) *Returns the raw unparsed response*
* source(\*) *Returns the source sentence Recast.AI processed*
* intents(\*) *Returns all the matched intents*
* intent(\*) *Returns the first matched intent*
* sentences(\*) *Returns all the detected sentences*
* sentence(\*) *Returns the first detected sentence*
* get(name) *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* all(name) *Returns all the entities matching -name-*
* version(\*) *Returns the version of the JSON*
* timestamp(\*) *Returns the timestamp at the end of the processing*
* status(\*) *Returns the status of the response*

### RecastAI::Sentence

The Recast.AI Sentence is generated by the Recast.AI Response initializer and provides the following methods:

* source(\*) *Returns the source of the sentence*
* type(\*) *Returns the type of the sentence*
* action(\*) *Returns the action of the sentence*
* agent(\*) *Returns the agent of the sentence*
* polarity(\*) *Returns the polarity (negation or not) of the sentence*
* entities(\*) *Returns all the entities detected in the sentence*

### RecastAI::Entity

The Recast.AI Entity is generated by the Recast.AI Sentence initializer and provides the following method:

* name(\*) *Returns the name of the entity*
* raw(\*) *Returns the raw text on which the entity was detected*

In addition to this method, more attributes are generated depending of the nature of the entity, which can be one of the following:

* hex(\*)
* value(\*)
* deg(\*)
* formated(\*)
* lng(\*)
* lat(\*)
* unit(\*)
* code(\*)
* person(\*)
* number(\*)
* gender(\*)
* next(\*)
* grain(\*)
* order(\*)

### RecastAI::RecastError

The Recast.AI Error is thrown when receiving an non-200 response from Recast.AI.

As it inherits from ::Exception, it implements the default expection methods.
