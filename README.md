# SAP Conversational AI - SDK Ruby

SAP Conversational AI official SDK in Ruby

## Synospis

This module is a wrapper around the [SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tool.sap) API, and allows you to:
* [Analyse your text](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-Ruby/wiki/01---Analyse-text)
* [Manage a conversation](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-Ruby/wiki/02---Manage-conversation)
* [Receive and send messages](https://github.com/SAPConversationalAI/SDK-Ruby/wiki/03---Receive-and-send-messages)

## Installation

This gem supports ruby 2.3+.

```bash
gem install Sapcai
```

You can now use the sdk in your code. All you need is your bot's token. In case you have enabled our versioning feature in the settings of your bot, you can refer to our [versioning documentation](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/versioning) to learn how to select the appropriate token for you versions and environments.

Using the entire SDK:
```ruby
require 'sapcai'

client = Sapcai::Client.new('YOUR_TOKEN')

client.request.analyse_text('Hi')
client.connect.broadcast_message('Hello')
```

Extracting one single API:
```ruby
require 'sapcai'

request = Sapcai::Request.new('YOUR_TOKEN')
request.analyse_text('Hi')

connect = Sapcai::Connect.new('YOUR_TOKEN')
connect.broadcast_message('Hi')
```
