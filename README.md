response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT)
#response = client.file_request(File.new(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), YOUR_FILE)))

## Specs

### Classes

This gem contains 5 main classes, as follows:

* RecastAI::Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
* RecastAI::Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* RecastAI::Intent represents an intent of the response.
* RecastAI::Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
* RecastAI::RecastError is the error thrown by the gem.

Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented ;)

### RecastAI::Client

The Recast.AI Client can be instanciated with a token (optional) and a language (optional) and provides the two following methods:

* text_request(text, options = {}) *Performs a text request*
* file_request(file, options = {}) *Performs a voice file request*

On each call to `text_request` or `file_request` your can override either your token or your language by passing a hash of options.

If no language is provided in the request, Recast.AI does the following:

* text_request: the language of the text is detected and is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used for processing.
* voice_request: your bot's primary language is used for processing as we do not provide language detection for speech.

If a language is provided, Recast.AI does the following:

* text_request: the language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used.
* voice_request: the language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used

*Accepted options are :token, :language, to override the defaults provided at initialization*

```ruby
require 'recastai'

client = RecastAI::Client.new(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR LANGUAGE)

# Performs a text request on Recast.AI
response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT, { token: YOUR_TOKEN, language: YOUR_LANGUAGE })

if response.intent.name == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT
  # Do your code...
end

# Performs a voice file request on Recast.AI
response = client.file_request(File.new(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__),YOUR_FILE)), { token: YOUR_TOKEN, language: YOUR_LANGUAGE })

if response.intent.name == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT
  # Do your code...
end
```

### RecastAI::Response

The Recast.AI Response is generated after a call with the two previous methods and contains the following methods:

* raw(\*) *Returns the raw unparsed response*
* source(\*) *Returns the source sentence Recast.AI processed*
* intents(\*) *Returns all the matched intents*
* intent(\*) *Returns the first matched intent*
* act(\*) *Returns the act of the processed sentence*
* assert?(\*) *Returns whether or not the act is an assertion*
* command?(\*) *Returns whether or not the act is a command*
* wh_query?(\*) *Returns whether or not the act is a wh-query*
* yn_query?(\*) *Returns whether or not the act is a yn-query*
* type(\*) *Returns the type of the processed sentence*
* abbreviation?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an abbreviation*
* entity?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an entity*
* description?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an description*
* human?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an human*
* location?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an location*
* number?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an number*
* negated?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is negated*
* sentiment(\*) *Returns the sentiment of the processed sentence*
* vpositive?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is very positive*
* positive?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is positive*
* neutral?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is neutral*
* negative?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is negative*
* vnegative?(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is very negative*
* entities(\*) *Returns all the entities*
* get(name) *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* all(name) *Returns all the entities matching -name-*
* language(\*) *Returns the language of the processed sentence*
* version(\*) *Returns the version of the API*
* timestamp(\*) *Returns the timestamp at the end of the processing*
* status(\*) *Returns the status of the response*

```ruby
response = client.text_request('Give me some recipes with potatoes. And cheese.')

# If the sentence is positive and the first intent matched is 'recipe'...
if response.positive? && response.intent.name == 'recipe'
  # ...get all the entities matching 'ingredient'
  ingredients = response.all('ingredient')

  puts "The request has been filled at #{response.timestamp}"
end
```

### RecastAI::Intent

The Recast.AI Intent is generated by the Recast.AI Response initializer and provides the following methods:

* name(\*) *Returns the name of the intent*
* confidence(\*) *Returns the confidence of detection for this intent*

```ruby
response = client.text_request('Tell me a joke.')

# If the intent is joke with a probability more than 50%
if response.intent.confidence > 0.5 && response.intent.name == 'joke'
  puts "A man enters a coffee, and splash"
else
  puts "What do you want from me?"
end
```

### RecastAI::Entity

The Recast.AI Entity is generated by the Recast.AI Response initializer and provides the following methods:

* name(\*) *Returns the name of the entity*
* raw(\*) *Returns the raw text on which the entity was detected*
* confidence(\*) *Returns the confidence of detection for this entity*

In addition to those default methods, more attributes are generated depending of the nature of the entity, which can be one of the following:

* hex(\*)
* rgb(\*)
* agent(\*)
* tense(\*)
* chrono(\*)
* value(\*)
* deg(\*)
* formated(\*)
* lng(\*)
* lat(\*)
* unit(\*)
* code(\*)
* person(\*)
* number(\*)
* gender(\*)
* next(\*)
* grain(\*)
* order(\*)

```ruby
response = client.text_request('What can I cook with salmon ?')

if response.intent.name == 'recipe'
  # Get the ingredient
  ingredient = response.get('ingredient')

  # Print the reply if the confidence is high enough
  puts "You asked me for a recipe with #{ingredient.value}" if ingredient.confidence > 0.7
end

```

### RecastAI::RecastError

The Recast.AI Error is thrown when receiving an non-200 response from Recast.AI.

As it inherits from ::Exception, it implements the default exception methods.
